# AB testing
Two tasks of split testing were implemented by using the frequency approach in this mini project.
Based on the proposed data, I determined which of the two proposed variants A or B was better.
In the first task, my solution has determined which design of the button gives the best performance.
In the second task, it has determined which subscription price provides better ROI.
